This directory contains all models that were developed by me for this thesis.

There are 5 types of models:
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- SDI-GAN
- SDI-GAN + intensity regularization (files called `sin-gan-proton`)
- SDI-GAN + intensity regularization + auxiliary regressor (files called `sin-gan-proton-aux-reg`)

There is also an `utils.py` file containing necessary functions
